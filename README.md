# Company Profit/Loss Forecasting

This project represents an interactive tool for forecasting a company's profit or loss based on the entered data regarding its revenues and expenses.

## Description

The project is developed as a web application using the Chart.js library and regression analysis tools to forecast a company's future profit or loss. Users can input data about the company's revenues and expenses over specific periods and indicate the forecasting duration. After inputting the data, the application automatically computes the profit/loss forecast using polynomial regression.

## Key Features

- Input and display of company revenue and expense data.
- Implementation of an interactive chart to visualize the entered data and profit/loss forecast.
- Capability to specify the forecasting duration for future months.
- Display of profit/loss forecast results within the application interface.

## Technologies

- Frontend: React.js, Chart.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- Libraries: polynomial-regression (for polynomial regression analysis).
